# F1 Announcer Bot
A bot that announces if there is an F1 race or qualifying race on the current day.

This bot uses the [Formula One API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11586746/SztEa7bL) to check if there is a race every day, running a daily job at 12:00am local time to request data from the API.

## What I learnt from this project
- Declaring new object types for use in other functions
- Better ways of scraping JSON from an API
